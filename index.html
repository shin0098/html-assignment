                Hello, my name is Jihyeon Shin. I’m from South Korea. I moved to Canada in 22<sup>nd</sup> August 2022.
                It is my first coding experience. It takes a lot of courage to start something new, but I’m trying to
                enjoy it. I’m excited about how much I could develop my skill and knowledge about Media. I’m liking
                forward to becoming a professional person through the <abbr title="Interative Media Design">IMD</abbr>
                program.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about <em>nature</em> and enjoy nature. I love four seasons. In spring and Fall, sitting
                on a bench whit looking at the sky is my favorite thing. I could go snorkelling in the sea in summer if
                I have good luck. I'm not a good runner, but I like walking. Skiing is my favorite sport. I’m already looking forward to skiing in Canada!

                <br>
